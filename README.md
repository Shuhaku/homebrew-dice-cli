A simple CLI tool that simulates a **pachinko-style decision maker**. You provide multiple options, and the script randomly picks one with an animated effect.

### Installation

You can install `dice-cli` using Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap shuhaku/dice-cli
brew install dice
```

### Usage

Run the dice command followed by a list of options:

```sh
dice apple banana cherry
```

### Example Output:

ðŸŽ² Starting the pachinko game! ðŸŽ²
ðŸŽ° apple ðŸŽ°
ðŸŽ° banana ðŸŽ°
ðŸŽ° cherry ðŸŽ°
ðŸŽ‰ Final choice: cherry ðŸŽ‰

### How It Works

â€¢ The script takes between 2 and 255 options.
â€¢ It runs a pachinko-style animation that cycles through the choices.
â€¢ After a short delay, it randomly selects a final choice and displays it.
